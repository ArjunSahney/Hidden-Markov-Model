# Hidden-Markov-Model

For this project, the task was to build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to actively tag parts of speech. The HMM incorporates Viterbi's Algorithm to find the predicted part of speech given an input of words. The training data is courtesy of Brown University. Code is written in Java.
